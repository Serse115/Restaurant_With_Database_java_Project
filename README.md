The project exists to represent the first attempt to creating, mantaining and handling a java software which simulates a restaurant system control to handle reservations, orders and the inventory.
The system is fully developed with the java language and its libraries, the gui is based on the java swing library and tools.
The system includes a fully self-mantained MySQL database, the process of creation and manteinance is available from the application itself and it doesn't require any MySQL knowledge or command thanks to the features of the application themselves.
The methods implemented in the application handle all the Back-End queries and processes through methods using the java.sql library and through MySql queries written and used as strings and as parameters for the method themselves.
The application needs to be in an environment where a version of MySQL is installed and functional, it will be necessary to log into the database through a name and password and the connection to the database can be cut or restarted anytime thrugh the application's features.
The full code source and launcher are available.
